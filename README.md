# SarsOutbreak

I analyzed a SarsOutbreak dataset that I got from Kaggle. I analyzed the data set using R. The variables the I looked at were the date of the cases, the cumulative number of cases, number of deaths, number of people who recovered, number of health care workers affected, the median age, country, and a couple of others. I made a lot of visulalizations such as histograms, bar graphs, box and whisker plots, and also some line graphs. I also did some averages, and sums of some variables from the dataset.
